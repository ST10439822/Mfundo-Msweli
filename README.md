WHAT IS MY APP ABOUT?​

​I call it Weather Pal , it is a user friendly and feature rich mobile application designed to provide accurate and up to date weather information to users. The app offers current weather conditions, forecast, and alerts for location all around the world.​

Upon opening the app, users are greeted with clean and intuitive interface that displays the current weather conditions for their default location. They can easily switch between different locations using pressing enter on the app itself.​

The application provides detailed weather forecast, including temperature, humidity and predicated chances. User can view minutes and dates of the weather when needed.​

One of the unique features of Weather Pal is that it's very easy to use and has an ability to provide personalized weather alerts. Users can set custom notification for specific weather conditions. Weather Pal also includes a range of additional features, like weather widges for home screen.
